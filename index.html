        <p>My name is Morgan Styers, I'm 23 years old and a Charlotte, North Carolina Native. I graduated from Cato
            Middle College Highschool with an Associates Degree in Art and Art Management. Directly following
            graduation, I was signed in Los Angeles, California, for modeling and acting. I moved myself and two
            cats to
            Koreatown where I lived for 5 years, was published in 6 magazines and completed 4 international
            commercials
            and 7 films, one of which I starred in.</p>

        <p> In my spare time, I love to do digital art and sculpture, play with my cats and collect sharksteeth,
            micro-minerals and band t-shirts. My favorite place to be in on the ocean and I absolutely love to sail.</p>
